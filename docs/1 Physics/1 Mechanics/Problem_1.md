# Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

1. Introduction
Projectile motion is a fundamental concept in physics, describing the motion of objects under gravity. The range of a projectile depends on factors such as initial velocity, launch angle, and gravity.

In this study, we analyze how the horizontal range varies with the launch angle. By deriving the governing equations and simulating different conditions, we identify the optimal angle for maximum range and explore real-world applications.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation: Deriving the Equations

To analyze projectile motion, we break it down into horizontal and vertical components.

### Kinematic Equations:

#### **Horizontal Motion (Constant Velocity)**
$$
x(t) = v_0 \cos(\theta) t
$$

#### **Vertical Motion (Constant Acceleration)**
$$
y(t) = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$
