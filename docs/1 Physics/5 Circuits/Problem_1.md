# Problem 1: Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

## Motivation

Calculating equivalent resistance is a key task in electrical circuit analysis. For simple networks, series and parallel rules are sufficient. However, for more complex circuits involving nested loops or multiple branches, these rules become tedious.

Graph theory offers a powerful and flexible solution: circuits can be modeled as **weighted graphs** where:

- **Nodes** represent connection points (junctions),
- **Edges** represent resistors with weights based on resistance values.

This method enables algorithmic simplification and automated analysis, particularly useful in large-scale simulations and electrical network design.

## 1. Problem Approach with Graph Theory

### 1.1 Circuit as a Graph

- A circuit is modeled as a graph $G(V,E)$.
- Each edge has an associated resistance $R$, converted to conductance $G = 1/R$.
- We use the **Laplacian matrix** of the graph to solve Kirchhoff‚Äôs current law equations.

## 2. Implementation (Python with NetworkX)

### 2.1 Kirchhoff-Based Resistance Solver

```python
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx

# Function to compute equivalent resistance using graph Laplacian
def equivalent_resistance(graph, node_a, node_b):
    G_matrix = nx.laplacian_matrix(graph, weight='conductance').toarray()
    n = len(G_matrix)

    b = np.zeros(n)
    b[node_a] = 1
    b[node_b] = -1

    try:
        potentials = np.linalg.lstsq(G_matrix, b, rcond=None)[0]
        current = potentials[node_a] - potentials[node_b]
        R_eq = 1.0 / current
        return abs(R_eq)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {e}"
```

## 2.2 Example Graph: Mixed Series and Parallel Configuration

### Create a circuit graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_nodes_from([0, 1, 2])

### Add resistors as edges with conductance attributes
G.add_edge(0, 1, resistance=2.0, conductance=1/2.0)
G.add_edge(1, 2, resistance=3.0, conductance=1/3.0)
G.add_edge(0, 2, resistance=6.0, conductance=1/6.0)

### Compute equivalent resistance between nodes 0 and 2
req = equivalent_resistance(G, 0, 2)
print(f"Equivalent resistance between node 0 and 2: {req:.3f} Ohm")

Equivalent resistance between node 0 and 2: 0.367 Ohm

## 3. Detailed Example Explanation

Let us consider a simple resistive circuit modeled as a graph with three nodes: **0**, **1**, and **2**. The circuit includes the following resistive components:

- A **2 Œ© resistor** between nodes **0** and **1**
- A **3 Œ© resistor** between nodes **1** and **2**
- A **6 Œ© resistor** directly between nodes **0** and **2**

![alt text](<output (3).png>)

Visually, this forms a **triangle-shaped circuit**, also known as a **3-node loop or cycle**. In traditional circuit analysis, one would manually analyze each possible series and parallel combination:

- The **path from 0 to 2** can occur either **directly** through the 6 Œ© resistor,  
- or **indirectly** via the two resistors in **series**: 0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2, which sums to 2 Œ© + 3 Œ© = **5 Œ©**.

This makes the problem a combination of **parallel and series** resistor relationships.

Using **graph theory**, we model the system as follows:

- Each **resistor** becomes an **edge** in an undirected graph.
- The **weight** of each edge is the **conductance** (inverse of resistance): $G = \frac{1}{R}$.
- We construct a **Laplacian matrix** $L$ based on the connectivity and weights.
- Kirchhoff‚Äôs current law (KCL) is applied implicitly through matrix equations:  
  $$
  L \cdot \vec{V} = \vec{b}
  $$
  where $\vec{b}$ encodes potential differences between the source and destination nodes.

By solving this system, we obtain the **potential at each node**, and from this, compute the **net current** between the input and output nodes. The **equivalent resistance** is then simply the **inverse of the current**, assuming a 1-volt potential difference was applied.

This approach abstracts away manual rule application and instead applies consistent, scalable linear algebraic computation.
