Theoretical Foundation To understand projectile motion, we start with the basic principles of physics. When an object is launched with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) , its motion occurs in two dimensions under the influence of gravity: horizontal (x) and vertical (y). Equations of Motion Horizontally , the velocity is constant (assuming no air resistance): [ x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot t ] Vertically , the motion is affected by gravitational acceleration \\( g \\) : [ y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] Range Equation The object hits the ground when \\( y = 0 \\) . Solving for time: [ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] This gives \\( t = 0 \\) (start) or \\( t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\) (landing time). Substituting into the horizontal equation: [ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\cdot 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)}{g} ] Using the trigonometric identity \\( 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta) \\) : [ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} ] Family of Solutions This equation depends on parameters like \\( v_0 \\) (initial velocity) and \\( g \\) (gravitational acceleration). Variations in these parameters produce a family of solutions with different ranges. 2. Analysis of the Range Dependence on Angle The range \\( R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\) shows that \\( R \\) depends on \\( \\theta \\) . The term \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) reaches its maximum when \\( 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\) , i.e., \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) (since \\( \\sin(90^\\circ) = 1 \\) ). Thus, the maximum range is: [ R_{max} = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} ] Influence of Parameters Increasing \\( v_0 \\) increases the range proportionally to \\( v_0^2 \\) . Increasing \\( g \\) decreases the range inversely (e.g., on the Moon, where \\( g \\) is smaller, the range increases). 3. Practical Applications Real-World Scenarios Uneven Terrain : If launched from a height ( \\( y_0 \\neq 0 \\) ), the range equation changes. Air Resistance : In reality, air resistance reduces velocity and range, requiring differential equations for modeling. Sports and Engineering : This model applies to soccer kicks, rocket launches, and more. 4. Implementation Below is a Python script to simulate and visualize the range as a function of the angle of projection: ```python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Parameters v0 = 20.0 # Initial velocity (m/s) g = 9.81 # Gravitational acceleration (m/s^2) angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 91) # Angles from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 (degrees) Range calculation (convert angles to radians) radians = np.deg2rad(angles) range_values = (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * radians)) / g Plot plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.plot(angles, range_values, label=f'v0 = {v0} m/s, g = {g} m/s\u00b2') plt.xlabel('Angle (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (m)') plt.title('Range vs. Projection Angle') plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.show() Find maximum range and corresponding angle max_range = np.max(range_values) max_angle = angles[np.argmax(range_values)] print(f\"Maximum range: {max_range:.2f} m, Angle: {max_angle}\u00b0\")","title":"Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1-investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Problem 1: Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-theoretical-foundation","text":"To understand projectile motion, we start with the basic principles of physics.
